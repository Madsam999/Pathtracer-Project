This is my long term personal pathtracing project. I started working on this project as a fun little thing to occupy myself while I wait to go back to school for my Master's degree. I am using Sebastian Lague's Raytracing Coding adventure video series as my inspiration for this project (https://youtu.be/Qz0KTGYJtUk?si=4BwZcCoiPCtCMkN3). 
Right now, there are 2 versions of the pathtracer. 
1. CPU-tracer:
This version of the pathtracer is ran on the CPU and is only able to render static images. It only supports spheres as of now, but you can modify their position and material (color, specularity, emission color and emission strength). It is quite slow and probably could be optimized further, however I do not plan on continuing my work on it, since I have a pathtracer running in real time on the GPU.

2. GPU-tracer:
This version of the pathtracer is ran on the GPU and can render scenes in real time. Just like the CPU-tracer, it only supports spheres, but I plan on adding support for more geometry (cubes, planes, meshes, etc.). The pathtracing logic is ran on a compute shader written in GLSL and then the resulting texture generated by the shader is then applied to a window large quad through a simple vertex and fragment shader. Since it runs on the GPU, this version is considerably faster.

In this project I use a few external libraries. For all my linear algebra needs I used the GLM library (https://github.com/g-truc/glm). The rendering is done with GLFW (https://www.glfw.org/) and OpenGl (https://www.opengl.org/). I did use stb (https://github.com/nothings/stb/tree/master) to save the renders from the GPU before having the real time component implemented, however it is no longer necessary and is in no way essential to the project. Finally, I use Dear ImGUI (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to have some UI elements to facilitate debugging and scene modification during code execution.

I don't have any long term plans for this project in terms of what I would like to implement. I'm kind of just following Sebastian Lague's videos and implementing features I think look or seem cool. I would like to get as far as my raytracer project that I did during my last semester (https://github.com/Madsam999/IFT3150_Cours_Projet) so I guess you could say that this is my long term goal.

Thanks for checking out my repo! I'll add renders in an image folder as I progress through the project!
